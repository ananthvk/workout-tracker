# Workout tracker
The primary purpose of this application is to track and derive insights into workout data. After a workout, people do not usually record or track details about their workout, such as weights used, reps performed, or total workout time. These details are crucial to record progress. This app can help to provide details and suggestions to enable the user to reach their goal.

## Goals
- Ease of use and ability to add workout details quickly
- Ability to add new workouts not on the app
- Cross-platform: Web and mobile
- Analysis of data with graphs, charts, and statistics
- Integration with fitness tracking apps (such as Google Fit)

## Tech stack
- Backend: Nodejs (fastify)
- Fronted: TBD
- Deployment: Docker
- Database: PostgreSQL
- CSS: TailwindCSS
